## Usage

Create a `deny.toml` file in the root of the repo to use as rules for the action ([example](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/blob/master/deny.toml)).
See [`cargo-deny`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) for instructions and details of the format and capabilities.

This action will run `cargo-deny check` and report failure if any banned crates or disallowed open source licenses are found used in the crate or its dependencies.

The action has three optional inputs

* `rust-version`: The rust/cargo version to use, updated before cargo-deny is run. Defaults to the version in the image, which is currently **1.71.0**.
* `log-level`: The log level to use for `cargo-deny`, default is `warn`
* `command`: The command to use for `cargo-deny`, default is `check`
* `arguments`: The argument to pass to `cargo-deny`, default is `--all-features`. See [Common Options](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/cli/common.html) for a list of the available options.
* `manifest-path`: The path to a Cargo.toml file to use as the root. Defaults to `./Cargo.toml`. Note this argument is always passed, so you can't have it in `arguments` as well, just set it it to the value you had in `arguments` if you were using it there.
* `command-arguments` The argument to pass to the command, default is emtpy. See options for [each command](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/cli/index.html).
* `credentials` This argument stores the credentials in the file `$HOME/git-credentials`, and configures git to use it. The credential must match the format `https://user:pass@github.com`

### Example pipeline

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  cargo-deny:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2
```

### Example pipeline with custom options using default values

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  cargo-deny:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2
      with:
        log-level: warn
        manifest-path: ./Cargo.toml
        command: check
        arguments: --all-features
        command-arguments: ""
        credentials: https://${{ secrets.GITHUB_USER }}:${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}@github.com
```

### Use specific Rust version

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  cargo-deny:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2
      with:
        rust-version: "1.60.0"
        log-level: warn
        command: check
        arguments: --all-features
```

### Recommended pipeline if not using advisories, to only run on dependency changes

If you use this pipeline, you should have `Cargo.lock` files checked into your
repository.

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**/Cargo.lock'
      - '**/Cargo.toml'
      - '**/deny.toml'
jobs:
  cargo-deny:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2
      with:
        command: check bans licenses sources
```

### Recommended pipeline if using advisories, to avoid sudden breakages

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  cargo-deny:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    strategy:
      matrix:
        checks:
          - advisories
          - bans licenses sources

    # Prevent sudden announcement of a new advisory from failing ci:
    continue-on-error: ${{ matrix.checks == 'advisories' }}

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2
      with:
        command: check ${{ matrix.checks }}
```
